This project involves implementing data analysis on data generated by an e-book digital marketplace owned by Company-X. The problem statement of this project stems 
from the “dirty” data collected the platform that was not being put to a good use to gain insightful knowledge and the client is putting an initiative in getting 
to know their consumers better. The data was extracted from enterprise databases of an e-commerce platform using Python and data visualization was accomplished 
by utilizing Google Data Studio.

A report was written to analyze this project and to measure the effectiveness of the data visualization for Company-X's employees. Report is available upon request.

Note: Company-X is not the real name of the company. The data in the visualization dashboard has been manipulated. This measures are taken to ensure data privacy.
However, data analysis was done based on the real raw data extracted from the company's databases. The work is published in my Github for educational and documentation
purposes.
